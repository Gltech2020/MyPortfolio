      <p>
        I am a tech enthusiast. Learning new things is my second hobby. I have
        learnt quite a bit since joining SheCodes. Valuable knowledge that I am
        ready to use in real work environment. My SheCodes journey is not
        complete without mentioning my mentor, the best tutor, Matt Delac. Matt
        simplified writing code and made it possible for any level learner. Your
        willingness to learn is what really counts at SheCodes.
        <br />
        <br />
        If I am not writing code, I enjoy outdoor activities like running and
        hiking. Travelling is also on my list and I make it a point to plan
        family trips with my family whenever we can.
